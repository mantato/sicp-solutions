Since new-if is a function, and not a special form, each parameter subexpression will be evaluated before the procedure is applied. It means that when executing the sqrt-iter function, (good-enough? guess x), guess and (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) will always be evaluated before new-if is applied, whatever (good-enough? guess x) evaluates to.

Since the second alternative (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) is calling the function recursively, the function will be stuck in an infinite loop. In this case, it is interesting to note that new-if will never be executed.
